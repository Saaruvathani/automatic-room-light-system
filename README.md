# automatic-room-light-system
This project implements an automatic room lighting system using the Arduino IDE. The system intelligently controls a light based on real-time sensor inputs, turning it ON only when motion is detected and the surrounding environment is dark.

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C/C++  
- PIR Motion Sensor  
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)  

## How It Works
- The PIR sensor detects human motion in the room.
- The LDR measures ambient light intensity.
- Conditional logic processes the sensor inputs.
- The light turns ON when motion is detected in low-light conditions and remains OFF otherwise.

## Key Concepts Used
- Conditional logic (if–else statements)
- Sensor input processing
- Embedded programming using Arduino
- Debugging and testing using the Serial Monitor

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with embedded C/C++ programming
- Improved understanding of logic-based automation systems
- Learned how software controls real-world hardware components
